   <b>1. Introduction</b> 
     
     <i>1.1 Purpose of Product</i>
     
     <p>My product is designed to be a helpful tool for those studying alone. Through my online platform a calming, no- distraction environment will be created to aid the user through studying. 8-bit theme will be customizable with its color pallete to suit user preferences. Little overall will be able to be customizable though so it will not distract users from the task at hand.</p>
     
     <i>1.2 Scope of Product</i>
     
    <p>What it includes:</p> 
     
     <p id="left">This project includes an non-over cluttered interface based on aesthetics
     
     A day to night mode for day studying or night time studying
     
     A way to track time
     
     What it doesn’t include: distracting graphics, everything is really static to keep the screen from being cluttered </p> 
     
    <i>1.3 Acronyms, Abbreviations, Definitions</i> 
     
    <p>Bi$h- Creator</p> 
     
    <i>1.4 References</i> 
     
    <p>Quick code references- https://iiviigames.github.io/pico8-api/</p> 
     
    <b>2. General Description of Product</b> 
     
    <p>This section contains a longer but not exhaustive description of your product.</p> 
     
    <i>2.1 Context of Product</i> 
     
     <p id="left">Pico-8</p>
     
     <i>2.2 Domain Model with Description</i>
     
     <p>Display and describe your domain model.</p>
     
     <i>2.3 Product Functions (general)</i>
     
     <p id="left"> My product will be able to have a user in the space to keep on track with study habits. A webpage or game interface will be launched to keep the user occupied.</p>
     
    <i>2.4 User Characteristics and Expectations</i> 
     
     <p>My users will be able to:</p>
     
     <p> -Login to the study space</p>
     
     <p> - Keep a study log</p>
     
    <p> - play music</p>
     
    <p> -customize day/ night</p>
     
    <p> -jot down notes</p> 
     
     <p> - have a timer to keep them on track with studying time vs studying breaks</p>
     
     <i>2.5 Constraints</i>
     
    <p>Due to the team only consisting of one person it’s limited to what the one person can produce and contribute alone. Using pico-8 alone is a good constraint because the creator won’t be over extended with biting off too many new languages or systems like building a game in unity where the creator has no experience.</p> 
     
    <i>2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies</i> 
     
    <p>Dependent on code limit in pico-8</p> 
     
     <b>3. Functional Requirements</b>
     
     <p>In a standard requirements document, you would have a LONG list of functional requirements here. You should put a link to your user story page here.</p>
     
     <b>4. System and Non-functional Requirements</b>
     
    <i>4.1 External Interface Requirements (User,Hardware,Software,Communications)</i> 
     
    <p> Requirements- pico-8 .</p> 
     
    <i>4.2 Performance Requirements</i> 
     
     <p>N/A. Then list specific requirements using item numbers as NF.4.2.X.</p>
     
     <i>4.3 Design Constraints</i>
     
     <p> Code will be limited to pico- 8 function parameters as well as code line limit.</p>
     
    <i>4.4 Quality Requirements</i> 
     
    <p>I expect my users to have a smooth working system within the 8-bit parameters. My system is not life critical.</p> 
     
     <i>4.5 Other Requirements</i>
     
     <p>NO.</p>
