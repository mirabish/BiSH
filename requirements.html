<b>1. Introduction</b> 
     
     <i>1.1 Purpose of Product</i>
     
     <p>My product is designed to be a helpful tool for those studying alone. Through my online platform a calming, no- distraction environment will be created to aid the user through studying. 8-bit theme will be customizable with its color pallete to suit user preferences. Little overall will be able to be customizable though so it will not distract users from the task at hand.</p>
     
     <i>1.2 Scope of Product</i>
     
    <p>What it includes:</p> 
     
    <p>This project includes an non-over cluttered interface based on aesthetics
     
     A day to night mode for day studying or night time studying
     
     A way to track time
     
     What it doesn’t include:</p> 
     
    <i>1.3 Acronyms, Abbreviations, Definitions</i> 
     
    <p>Bi$h- Creator</p> 
     
    <i>1.4 References</i>

    <b>2. General Description of Product</b> 
     
    <p>This section contains a longer but not exhaustive description of your product.</p> 
     
    <i>2.1 Context of Product</i> 
     
     <p>Pico-8</p>
     
     <i>2.2 Domain Model with Description</i>
     
     <p>Display and describe your domain model.</p>
     
     <i>2.3 Product Functions (general)</i>
     
     <p>Basic overview of the capabilities of your product. This is not your list of functional requirements, but an overview. Part of your problem statement might be good here.</p>
     
    <i>2.4 User Characteristics and Expectations</i> 
     
     <p>My users will be able to:</p>
     
     <p> -Login to the study space</p>
     
     <p> - Keep a study log</p>
     
    <p> - play music</p>
     
    <p> -customize day/ night</p>
     
    <p> -jot down notes</p> 
     
     <p> - have a timer to keep them on track with studying time vs studying breaks</p>
     
     <i>2.5 Constraints</i>
     
    <p>Due to the team only consisting of one person it’s limited to what the one person can produce and contribute alone. Using pico-8 alone is a good constraint because the creator won’t be over extended with biting off too many new languages or systems like building a game in unity where the creator has no experience.</p> 
     
    <i>2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies</i> 
     
    <p>Dependent on code limit in pico-8</p> 
     
     <b>3. Functional Requirements</b>
