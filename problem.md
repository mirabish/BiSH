# Problem Statement

[Back to home](README.md)

The Study Story game application is targeted is used to aid student or anyone trying to get work done in a more focused environment. The game will be able to offer a calm environment while the user gets their work done.
    
The aesthetic environment keeps studying lively without it being distracting. A way to keep track of timne, lo-fi music, will keep users engaged, but notave too much to look at.
 
## Scope  

The game would be free on Lexolaffle and available to those with pico8 license as well as those who don't have a pico-8 license. 


## Context 

As a student I go in and out of study routines. I'm always looking for something new to add to my routine that will make my studying more proactive. I want to work more and retain all of the information. I don't want to rewatch lectures or wonder why my "6 hour" study session didn't make me a master at any subject. Sometimes I feel more disoriented after those wondering what I even did for 6 hours. This game/ platoform will add to the lo-fi study beats and timer as well as a tracker to keep you on task at what needs to get accomplished.
