    <h1> Context </h1> 
    <p style = "font-size: 15" align="left"> 
        As a student I go in and out of study routines. I'm always looking for something new to add to my routine that will make my studying more proactive. 
        I want to work more and retain all of the information. I don't want to rewatch lectures or wonder why my "6 hour" study session didn't make me a master 
        at any subject. Sometimes I feel more disoriented after those wondering what I even did for 6 hours. This game/ platoform will add to the lo-fi study beats
        and timer as well as a tracker to keep you on task at what needs to get accomplished.
