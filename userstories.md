# User 1.1: the student

[Back to home](README.md)

# 1.2. Student pomodoro. 
   I have recently seen on social media a technique Called the pomodoro where you set a timer to increment you work. Personally I would like an interface where I can log in the amount of time I have studied. And also the amount of time I have maybe slacked off? It would be cool to have a customizable space where I can have these timers that is also kind of cute. 

* Elaboration: User should be able to log multiple aspects of their study session. How much time was wasted doing other things than studying etc. 
* Constraints: None
* Effort Estimation: 3 Hours 
* Performance test: User will be able to check their active time by approaching the given interaction queue or by going to “bed” in game.

# 1.3.  Motivation. 
 I have a hard time staying motivated when I am studying, sometimes it kind of helps me to have something to motivate me or keep me on track. Personally I would like to have a motivational text or jingle on screen when I have studied for 25 minutes consistently just to keep me on track and happy that I am being disciplined in my studies. 
* Elaboration: After a given increment of 25 minutes or a time set by the user. The interface will give the user a jingle and a motivational message to let them know that they are doing great job. 
* Constraints: None 
* Effort Estimation: 2 hours 
* Performance Test: To save time, timer is set at different increments of 10, 15, 25 minutes. Just to make sure that the jingle and text are being triggered at the given time the user chooses 

# 2.2 Music relaxes me and helps me get in the zone. 
   I really want something that is going to mellow me out and get me focused for the work that I am going to do at hand. As a student I am really into those lo-fi beats that are on YouTube. Typically my study sessions last bout 1 hour. And I would like a feed back loop that wouldn’t get to repetitive when is study. 
Elaboration: User wants music that isn’t going to sound repetitive in their study session. They need enough time between their 30 minute lo-fi loop to not recognize or notice that the track or tracks aren’t being replayed. 
Constraints: none
Effort Estimation:  2 hours
Performance test: Play the beginning and end of the pico-8 study mix to make sure the sound is seamless and not recognizable. 


#2.3 Different Genre’s 
	I would kind of like something to switch between. Either something that is kind of mellow or upbeat. Depends on the mood. Lo-fi can get kind of gloomy, so It would be nice to be able to switch tracks that is more personalized to me. 
* Elaboration: User should be able to swap tracks in their little study house/room so that it offers a more personalized experience for the user. 
* Constraints: Memory, sound effects in pico can take up a lot of space. So having a large library may be difficult to manage. 
 * Effort Estimation:  2 hours 
* Performance test: using a button such as C to switch tracks on a interactive music sprite in pico-8

# 3.2 Visuals 
Studying is a bit of a ritual, I enjoy a darker theme when I study, I want a space that isn’t too gloomy but just right in lighting to match my vibes of getting my most efficient work done. 
* Elaboration: Home is customizable in color. And it comes in a more relaxing color for the eyes, so the user doesn’t feel annoyed by the overall brightness of the interface. 
* Constraints: none 
* Effort Estimation: 1 Hour
* Performance test: running in the pico IDE 

# 3.3 Navigation 
    I would like to be able to feel like I have a mini safe space for my studying. Somewhat Like a home. A room a bed a kitchen table. All of which I can kind of play with to decompressed and make me feel like I have control over my little interface.
* Elaboration: User wants an interface they can navigate that has some type of interaction over .
* Constraints: Memory again. The game is running sound and effects so sprite swaps and customizability might be difficult to keep on the cart memory. 
* Effort estimation: 1 hour
* Performance test: User is able to interact with a tv, or kitchen that asks for a timer or even what they are going to cook 

# 3.4 Character Customization
It would be cute to be able to customize my character with different clothing styles just so it fits more my personal aesthetic. And what I am trying to accomplish with the study story. Because it is my Study story.
Elaboration: User should have a more deep personal connection with their study story so they feel comfortable and safe using the interface. 
* Constraints: Memory 
* Effort estimation: 2 hours
* Performance test: Create a closet sprite so that the user has two or three outfits to pick from.
* 	NOTE: This test case was unable to be carried out in the final version.
